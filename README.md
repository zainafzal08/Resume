# resume

> A little site to show off my code!

## todo

1. transfer landing to be more component based
2. make each component work in mobile.

## show off points

remember to show off about summer internship
link twitter (also set up twitter lmao)

## idea

z index seperates poster images, as you scroll it flips through them, each one with a project on it.
(have a small dot based system for jumping between)
keep to pure github atm, the live sites need work yikes.

## pages

page on multipel web escarping scripts
page on sec seoc stuff
rest copy
maybe chuck in adventure buddy?
nodeboard?
check out github i dunno lol. Maybe chuck in svg stuff with a overall web dev page

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
